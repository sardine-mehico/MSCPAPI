"""High-level Copilot client — the recommended entry point.

One client, many conversations addressed by id. :meth:`CopilotClient.chat`
returns the full reply plus the conversation id; pass that id back to continue
the same conversation, or omit it to start a fresh one. :meth:`CopilotClient.stream`
is the incremental variant.

    from copilot import CopilotClient

    client = CopilotClient()                       # loads signed-in auth once
    r = client.chat("My name is Tomato. Remember it.")
    print(r.text, r.conversation_id)

    r2 = client.chat("What's my name?", r.conversation_id)   # continue
    print(r2.text)

    for chunk in client.stream("Tell me a joke"):  # new conversation, streamed
        print(chunk, end="", flush=True)

The signed-in access token is refreshed transparently; sign in once with
``python -m copilot login``. Pass ``anonymous=True`` to skip sign-in (only where
anonymous consumer chat is available), or ``proxy=...`` to route through a
supported region.
